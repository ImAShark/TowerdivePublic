# TowerdivePublic

This is a preview repository of a private project.
The code is not present/fully present for privacy reasons.

This is a prototype for a First Person Shooter with rogue-like aspects.
You can choose from a variety of guns that can be upgraded with the drops from enemies you defeat.
The level you play in is randomly generated from preset floors that stack on top of each other.
When you enter a new floor waves of enemies will spawn and attack you with their guns.
